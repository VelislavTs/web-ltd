# Web.

**The local bakery of websites**

---

## Brand Concept

Web is a freelance web development business positioned around craft, simplicity, and local Bulgarian culture.

### The Core Idea

In the Sofia/Pernik region, "уеб" (web) sounds like "хляб" (bread). This creates a natural metaphor:

- **Not**: "We build websites"
- **But**: "We bake websites"

This isn't explained directly to users—it's encoded into the brand feel through:

- Warm, craft-focused language
- "Made fresh daily" / "Baked fresh" positioning
- "No unnecessary ingredients" service descriptions
- "Local bakery of websites" positioning

### Brand Positioning

**English**: "The local bakery of websites"
**Bulgarian**: "Местната фурна за сайтове"

Web is positioned as the small local studio that makes simple, honest websites for real businesses—the way a neighborhood bakery makes bread.

### Voice & Tone

- **Simple**: No corporate jargon, no tech buzzwords
- **Honest**: Direct pricing, clear timelines, no overselling
- **Warm**: Human, approachable, trustworthy
- **Local**: Bulgarian roots, community-focused
- **Craft**: Made properly, no shortcuts, no stale templates

### Key Messages

**English**:
- "Web, baked fresh"
- "No unnecessary ingredients"
- "Made simple, done right, made human"
- "Simple websites for local businesses"

**Bulgarian**:
- "Уеб. Направен как трябва."
- "Без излишни съставки"
- "Местната фурна за сайтове"
- "Прости сайтове за местни бизнеси"
